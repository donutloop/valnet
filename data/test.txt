0,In theory they actually are recyclable, and they are made from partially recycled plastic. In practice, very few councils in the UK recycle any plastic that isn’t clear. The technology to do so has been really expensive. For years, the biggest challenge has always been finding a tray that is both food safe and can go straight from the freezer to the oven. Until recently there hasn’t been a realistic alternative to plastic. However, the technology is finally catching up and we’re currently working on a trial to replace our plastic trays with a fully recyclable, paper-based version, similar to the kind we introduced with our new pie range last autumn. We’re going to start using it with all of our Kids Meals, and it will then take a while to be sure that it’s robust enough for us to use more widely. Until the trial is complete it’s hard to give a realistic timeframe but we should have a good idea of the potential of the new tray material within the next few months. If all goes well, we’ll get the ball rolling as quickly as we can.

0,strong John Gardner (no affiliation) This is the fourth place entry in the third round of the NIST Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge. The goal of this challenge is to produce differentially private synthetic data while retaining as much useful information as possible about the original data set. Colorado census data from 1940 with 98 field columns were provided for algorithm development with census data from other states used for testing. This solution groups together fields which have been found to be highly correlated. For each of these groups, a histogram is created for the purpose of counting the number of occurrences of every possible combination of values of all fields in the group. For privatization, Laplacian noise is added to every bin with scale proportional to the number of groups / total epsilon. Synthetic data is generated by selecting a random bin for each group with probability weighted by these noisy bin counts. The field values corresponding to each group's selected bin are written out as a single row of synthetic data.

From the get-go, we heard from stakeholders a desire to model the Privacy Framework structure after the Cybersecurity Framework such as using the construct of the Core with its high-level Functions, and increasingly granular set of protection activities and outcomes. But there were mixed responses on whether the Privacy Framework and the Cybersecurity Framework should have overlapping Functions with respect to data security, so we decided to workshop it. We proposed two options for the Privacy Framework Core to discuss at our in Boise, Idaho: included Functions from the Cybersecurity Framework to address data security, while did not.
