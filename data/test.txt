0,Can I place an order for UK delivery from overseas?
0,In theory they actually are recyclable, and they are made from partially recycled plastic. In practice, very few councils in the UK recycle any plastic that isn’t clear. The technology to do so has been really expensive. For years, the biggest challenge has always been finding a tray that is both food safe and can go straight from the freezer to the oven. Until recently there hasn’t been a realistic alternative to plastic. However, the technology is finally catching up and we’re currently working on a trial to replace our plastic trays with a fully recyclable, paper-based version, similar to the kind we introduced with our new pie range last autumn. We’re going to start using it with all of our Kids Meals, and it will then take a while to be sure that it’s robust enough for us to use more widely. Until the trial is complete it’s hard to give a realistic timeframe but we should have a good idea of the potential of the new tray material within the next few months. If all goes well, we’ll get the ball rolling as quickly as we can.

0,You can, although our system is always confused by foreign postcodes. The trick is, when registering your address, enter as normal but use the delivery address postcode rather than your own. (The billing address is just for our records, so won’t affect the order.)

0,又比如，在我们法狗狗所在的法律推理领域，有些时候并不一定需要使用一个完全的认知世界模型，因为在法律中的概念都是一些联系着大量社会、文化概念的，我们无法立即模拟出来。虽然无法做到对虚拟概念的真正映射，但对于虚拟概念的推理，却有着大量的法律法规可以来去做一些法理逻辑上的推演，最后可以计算是否存在逻辑上的合理或不合理。所以对于一些狭窄的语言推理应用，并不一定需要一个庞大的 Grounded World（映射到真实的世界中）来去实现推理，可以把真实世界的模型精简再精简，最后精简成一个足够完善的符号推理世界（知识图谱）可能就能完成一部分的需求。

0,OK, it’s not exactly cage match material, but if we want to make meaningful progress on optimizing beneficial uses of data while minimizing adverse consequences for individuals (or society as a whole) we need to grapple with these issues. From the get-go, we heard from stakeholders a desire to model the Privacy Framework structure after the Cybersecurity Framework such as using the construct of the Core with its high-level Functions, and increasingly granular set of protection activities and outcomes. But there were mixed responses on whether the Privacy Framework and the Cybersecurity Framework should have overlapping Functions with respect to data security, so we decided to workshop it. We proposed two options for the Privacy Framework Core to discuss at our in Boise, Idaho: included Functions from the Cybersecurity Framework to address data security, while did not.

0,strong John Gardner (no affiliation) This is the fourth place entry in the third round of the NIST Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge. The goal of this challenge is to produce differentially private synthetic data while retaining as much useful information as possible about the original data set. Colorado census data from 1940 with 98 field columns were provided for algorithm development with census data from other states used for testing. This solution groups together fields which have been found to be highly correlated. For each of these groups, a histogram is created for the purpose of counting the number of occurrences of every possible combination of values of all fields in the group. For privatization, Laplacian noise is added to every bin with scale proportional to the number of groups / total epsilon. Synthetic data is generated by selecting a random bin for each group with probability weighted by these noisy bin counts. The field values corresponding to each group's selected bin are written out as a single row of synthetic data.
