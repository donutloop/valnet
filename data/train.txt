0,strong John Gardner (no affiliation) This is the fourth place entry in the third round of the NIST Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge. The goal of this challenge is to produce differentially private synthetic data while retaining as much useful information as possible about the original data set. Colorado census data from 1940 with 98 field columns were provided for algorithm development with census data from other states used for testing. This solution groups together fields which have been found to be highly correlated. For each of these groups, a histogram is created for the purpose of counting the number of occurrences of every possible combination of values of all fields in the group. For privatization, Laplacian noise is added to every bin with scale proportional to the number of groups / total epsilon. Synthetic data is generated by selecting a random bin for each group with probability weighted by these noisy bin counts. The field values corresponding to each group's selected bin are written out as a single row of synthetic data.

0,The Fourth Amendment grew out of the experiences of early Americans, who disagreed with the British Crown's use of general warrants to undermine political adversaries by searching for writings or publications that decried the British leadership and its policies. Later, in colonial America, general warrants were again used to gain entry to colonist's homes to search for goods on which taxes had not been paid. As a result, the Fourth Amendment's concept of privacy revolves largely around the notion of being free from government physical intrusion - which is understandable, given the Amendment's text and history.

0,Monitoring of North Korean, Chinese, and Soviet air communications was done from listening posts in South Korea, but there were hearability problems for certain areas at different times of the day. To solve these problems, in mid-1951 the AFSS established an intercept site on Paengyong-do - commonly known as "P-Y-do" by Americans - a UN-held island close to the west coast of North Korea. Since this was close to enemy territory, the security regulations had to be relaxed, and 5th Air Force had to provide special evacuation service. Eventually the Americans abandoned their effort on the island.

The SIS gave the first Japanese machine they attempted a covername from the first color of the spectrum -- RED. With a solid background now in machine systems, Kullback commented in retrospect,"it wasn't very difficult really for us to work it out."

0,The creation of SIGSALY was only part of the challenge required to construct a secure worldwide voice system. A cadre of highly skilled individuals was required to run the newly created device effectively. This requirement was fulfilled in 1942 by the formation of the 805th Signal Service Company. Their mission was to maintain and operate the SIGSALY communications secure network between army headquarters in Washington and overseas locations throughout the world. All personnel were hand-picked for their special talents and qualifications; the group included individuals with extensive backgrounds in electronics and telephony. Classes were originally held in New York City to allow instructors from Bell Labs easy access to the school and the students. In July 1944, both the school and the headquarters of the 805th were moved to the Pentagon in Washington. By that time, a total of 193 officers and men had been trained. The unit would eventually reach a total of 356 individuals: 81 officers and 275 enlisted men. These individuals were assigned to 12 separate detachments, each consisting of 5 officers and 10 enlisted men. Each detachment was expected to operate on a 24-hour basis.

0,The National Security Agency/Central Security Service Cryptologic Memorial exhibit is a replica of the black granite wall found in the NSA Headquarters building at Ft. Meade, MD. It is intended to honor and remember those who have given their lives, "serving in silence," in the line of duty since 1950. The Memorial was built in 1995 and lists the names of those cryptologists, military and civilian, who have made the ultimate sacrifice. The Memorial Wall was designed by an NSA employee and is 12 feet wide and eight feet high, centered with a triangle. The words "They Served in Silence," etched into the polished stone at the cap of the triangle, recognize that cryptologic service has always been a silent service — secretive by its very nature. Below these words, the NSA seal and the names of 177 military and civilian cryptologists (as of 01/19) who have given their lives in service to their country are engraved in the granite. The names are at the base of the triangle because these cryptologists and their ideals — dedication to mission, dedication to workmate, and dedication to country — form the foundation for cryptologic service.

0,The U.S. Navy's Cryptanalytic Bombe is the culmination of years of work and the efforts of mathematicians and engineers from Poland, England, and the United States. It was the solution to the problem of Germany's World War II 4-rotor cipher machine Enigma, and it led to the Allies' successes in the battle of the Atlantic and the war in Europe. In 1942 a fourth rotor was added to the U-boat Enigmas and the original British Bombes, designed to solve the three-rotor Enigmas, were not able to find solutions to those messages. WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service) were inducted into the U.S. Navy and built and operated the Bombes, working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They set the machines up and tested the results. The U.S. Navy Bombes rapidly searched the hundreds of thousands of possible settings on one wheel order of a four-rotor Enigma. (The German Navy had eight wired rotors from which to select three that went into the Enigmas. The fourth rotor remained in its position.) The Navy Bombes, and those who built and operated them, played a crucial role in saving Allied and Axis lives and hastened the end of the war in the Atlantic and Europe.

0,Rejewski was then joined by two other Polish mathematicians, Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy Rozycki, and together they were able to overcome many of these difficulties, and could read some German Army and Air Force messages by the time World War II began in 1939. The Polish Army was quickly overrun by the Germans, however, and the Poles who worked on the problem fled from Poland through Southern Europe and made their way to France by early 1940. There they continued their work with the French until France itself was defeated by the Germans in June 1940. Many of the Poles then fled through Spain and Portugal and went to Great Britain where they served out the war continuing the fight against their German enemy. They passed on what they had learned and accomplished, making it possible for British mathematicians to take up their work.

0,The 1930s saw a reinvigorated Germany begin to re-arm under the leadership of the Nazi Party and Adolf Hitler. This included continuing to build on efforts begun in the 1920s to create secure communications. Germany had suffered significant losses to its submarine fleet in World War I (1914-1918) because of the ability of the Western allies, especially France and Great Britain, to take advantage of weaknesses in the codes and ciphers the Germans had used to try to protect the secrecy of their communications. In addition, a primary reason for the entry of the United States into the war had been the ability of the British to read a secret German diplomatic cable (the Zimmermann Telegraph). The Germans were determined to correct this problem and make sure that in any future war they would be able to pass messages amongst themselves while keeping others from being able to read those messages.

The Army Security Agency used a wide variety of aircraft as well to conduct aerial reconnaissance missions. The U.S. Navy also began its surveillance as early as 1962, conducting shore, shipborne, and aerial reconnaissance. Information derived from signals and electronic intelligence flowed quickly back to the commanders in the field. National Security Agency civilians worked side by side with their military counterparts and the South Vietnamese. Those stationed at NSA in the United States worked around-the-clock processing, translating, and forwarding this vital intelligence.

0,The system required that the key be used in twenty millisecond segments. Therefore, it was necessary for each record to be kept in synchronism within a few milliseconds for fairly long periods of time (one hour or so). This was accomplished by the use of very precisely driven turntables. The turntables themselves were remarkable machines. Each was driven by a large (about thirty-pound) synchronous electric motor with hundreds of poles. The motor was kept in constant operation, and the power for it was derived directly from dividing down the terminal's frequency standard. The frequency standard was a 100 kHz crystal oscillator. The accuracy of the standard had to be maintained within about one part in ten million so that the system would stay in synchronism for long periods of time. The system frequency standard could be corrected by comparing it to an available national frequency standard (which was WWV in the U.S.).

0,The lack of appropriate resources made Walker's job difficult, but the information from SIGINT proved to be a great equalizer. From the beginning of the siege, Walker had been provided with valuable information such as the exact locations of North Korean positions and detailed information on enemy airfields and general enemy air strength. In mid-August a strange calm fell across the battlefield. Intercepts indicated that the North was regrouping and rearming its forces. Obviously, an enemy offensive was in the works. By the end of the month, the North Korean attacks had resumed with a vengeance. At one point the perimeter was briefly breached, forcing Walker to move his headquarters from Taegu to Pusan. During this crucial time, Walker continued to frantically shuttle his units from one embattled location to another. Aiding him in this desperate situation were detailed enemy intercepts that provided crucial information on the North Korean Army's capabilities and plans. With this priceless information, Walker was able to determine North Korean intentions and commit his embattled forces with maximum efficiency.

0,The lack of attention to the North Korean problem radically changed with the 25 June attack. With American troops fighting in Korea, the North Korean problem jumped to the top of the priority list. Changes were immediately made in the assignments to intercept sites. In the two weeks after the start of the war, the number of intercept positions collecting North Korean traffic increased from two to twelve: two Air Force positions, one Navy, and nine Army. The additional coverage was obtained by diverting intercept positions from other targets, bringing in additional personnel, or having people work overtime. At the start of the war, any signal with properties that could be construed as North Korean was copied and forwarded to AFSA and ASAPAC for analysis.

Although in 1950 the FBI uncovered information alleging espionage activities by Weisband in the early 1940s, he was never charged with espionage - Weisband lost his job with AFSA and served a year in prison for contempt of a grand jury.

0,AFSA was unprepared for the war with North Korea on the analytic front as well. In June 1950, there was one traffic analyst working on North Korean communications part-time, one part-time cryptanalyst, and one Korean linguist. The linguist was a senior Japanese linguist who had been studying Korean in his spare time since July 1949. It is unknown how far his Korean studies had progressed by June 1950. Preliminary work on the small number of North Korean messages available indicated that there were probably two networks in use, likely carrying North Korean military and North Korean police communications. However, the low volume of traffic, the little time the analysts could spend studying the North Korean messages, and the lack of linguists available to assist in the work severely hampered the production of intelligence from these communications. The limited effort was further hindered by the fact that there were no Korean dictionaries, books on the Korean language, nor Korean typewriters available!

Soviet MiG-17 pilots shot down the USAF C-130 when American pilots strayed into restricted airspace over Soviet Armenia. It was supposed to fly a "race track" pattern between the Turkish cities of Trabzon and Van essentially parallel to the Armenian border. Initially, the Soviets denied shooting down the aircraft, claiming the plane and its 17 crew members "fell" into their territory. It was not until the end of the Cold War that they released previously classified documents indicating that all 17 U.S. personnel had died in the crash. An Air Force C-130 was refurbished and painted to match the markings of the down aircraft, #60528. It was flown to Fort Meade and dedicated at the National Vigilance Park on September 2, 1997.

0,This site is a mock-up of the World War I intercept site in Souilly, France. The exhibit is based on two pictures of the original shack. Intercepting the enemy's radio communication was imperative for success during WWI. At the outbreak of war in August 1914, the German Army successfully used vital radio intercepts, enabling them to defeat the Russian 2nd Army in the Battle of Tannenberg. Soon all the major participants in World War I would go on to use more encompassing communications intelligence (COMINT) with varying degrees of success. Although signals intelligence was in its infancy, and radio was the new communications technology, the U.S. Army's Radio Intelligence Section used their newfound capabilities to "spy" on enemy conversation. Signals could be intercepted without being in close proximity to the transmitter or transmission lines and could provide vital information about enemy tactics and strategy.

0,And so, the North Korean target was ignored, and no intercept site collected North Korean signals until 1949. Collection began inadvertently in April 1949 when a U.S. Army intercept station began collecting communications sent on an unidentified net using Soviet procedures. After some analysis in the field, the material was tentatively identified through direction finding as North Korean. In April 1950, the collected data were forwarded to AFSA for further analysis. After some study, AFSA analysts concurred that the intercept was North Korean. Dedicated North Korean collection was initiated on 21 April 1950 when, at the request of G2 (Intelligence Staff), AFSA tasked an intercept position in Japan to search for North Korean communications. A second position was added sometime before the end of June, and approximately 200 messages were collected before the war began. While the two intercept positions dedicated to North Korea took away from the higher priority Chinese and Russian targets, the loss was deemed necessary so AFSA could obtain the minimum coverage essential to develop a knowledge of North Korean communications for future COMINT needs.

0,In the period prior to the Korean War, U.S. communications intelligence underwent major structural and doctrinal changes. The Army Security Agency (ASA) had shared the national COMINT mission with the Navy's Communications Supplementary Activity (COMMSUPACT) - which became the Naval Security Group in June 1950. During and after World War II, a portion of Army COMINT assets was dedicated to support of the U.S. Army Air Corps, and, when the independent Air Force was created in 1947, these cryptologic assets were resubordinated to the new organization as the Air Force Security Service (AFSS).

KPCC's Adolfo Guzman-Lopez reports, the raids did change the way museums across the country conduct business.

0,In spite of such obvious successes, several individuals questioned the praise given AFSA for SIGINT successes during the Korean War. For example, in June 1952 General James A. Van Fleet, commanding general of the U.S. 8th Army, wrote: "Today, our intelligence operations in Korea have not yet approached the standards that we reached in the final year of [World War II]." The director of NSA concurred with this observation in March 1953. The achievements of SIGINT during World War II were far superior to those in the Korean War. However, this observation must be considered in light of the situation in June 1950. At the start of World War II, analysis of Japanese and German communications had been going on for over a decade. By contrast, in-depth analysis of North Korean communications did not start until after the war began on 25 June 1950.

When he left home he was intent on being a doctor, and had completed pre-med studies at Northwestern University when he entered World War I as an Army second lieutenant. He knew immediately that the Army would be his life, and never had a second thought about a medical career. He served in various combat posts in France, and elected to stay in the Army after the armistice was signed in 1918. The interwar period (1919-1941) was his education, when he traveled from one Army post to another, filling just about any job that was vacant. When World War II broke out, Canine was well fitted for responsibility. He became the chief of staff for the XII Corps, which served in George Patton's Third Army during its historic race across France in 1944. After the war he was rewarded with command of the First Infantry Division, one of the most prestigious of Army jobs.

0,The intercept operators' experience at the station at Guam illustrates some of the non-technical difficulties COMINT personnel faced. The operations building had been built of coral mortar blocks by the Spanish prior to 1898. When it was occupied in 1929, the building's floor was rotting. The damp and humidity meant that paper and equipment mildewed rapidly. The Navy's own radio transmissions from Guam interfered with intercept. Eventually, the collection site was moved to an abandoned hospital where conditions were somewhat better.

0,The Army, by the way, was not making comparable efforts against Japanese Army communications because of a lack of traffic. While the Japanese Navy was deployed throughout the Pacific and was forced to communicate by radio over long distances, the Japanese Army's overseas deployment in the late 1930s was largely in China; their long-distance communications were less in volume than the Navy's, and in areas less vulnerable to U.S. intercept.

Yardley began his career as a code clerk with the U.S. State Department, and during that service discovered his natural talent as a cryptanalyst.

To earn money, Yardley wrote which revealed to the world the work of MI-8. It became an international best seller. However, it angered the American government and jeopardized cryptologic activities.

0,Agnes Meyer Driscoll's work as a navy cryptanalyst who broke a multitude of Japanese naval systems, as well as a developer of early machine systems, marks her as one of the true "originals" in American cryptology. She was born in 1889, and, in 1911, she received an A.B. degree from Ohio State University, majoring in mathematics, physics, foreign languages, and music. From her earliest days as a college student, Agnes Meyer pursued technical and scientific studies atypical for a woman of the times. After graduation, she moved to Amarillo, Texas, where she was director of music at a military academy, and, later, chair of the mathematics department at the local high school.

0,Because of fears of the further spread of Communism and the obvious failure of appeasement before World War II, President Truman responded quickly. American sea and air power was committed to assist South Korea on 27 June, and ground forces were committed on 30 June. General Douglas MacArthur, United States commander in chief in Asia, transferred units from the American army of occupation in Japan to Korea in early July. Due to the need to move rapidly to provide assistance to the South Koreans, the arriving U.S. troops were out of shape, not well equipped, poorly trained, and almost totally unfamiliar with the Korean terrain. As a result, the UN forces, consisting mostly of Americans and South Koreans, were terribly torn up by the North Korean attacks. Throughout July, the KPA pushed the UN forces south, inflicting dreadful casualties in the process.

Systems were started at prearranged times. For example, Washington and London might agree to start at precisely 1200 GMT. Prior to starting, the phonograph pickup was indexed to the first record groove. This process consisted of listening to the pickup output click as it was slid along the edge of the record in order to determine when it fell into the first groove. This was easier with the original hard records than with the softer acetate records.

0,Beyond just its inability as currently applied to keep pace with technology, the Fourth Amendment also suffers from even greater limitations when it comes to protecting your privacy: it is powerless to protect you against any private sector activity. It simply doesn't apply to private companies. This legal framework is far different from the notion of privacy that has driven European lawmaking and court decisions. Unlike the US, the concept of privacy in Europe focuses instead on the dignity of the person and it very much extends to private sector activity. Traditionally, this has resulted in laxer regulation of government surveillance, but much stricter laws about, for example, data protection, credit reporting, and workplace privacy. Europeans value the right to be left alone and protection from public embarrassment or humiliation. These concepts are so important to Europeans that they were woven into the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights, which mandates respect for private and family life and protection of personal data.

In the 1950s, Soviet advances in rocket science increased the possibility that the continental United States could become a nuclear battleground. Washington's (incorrect) assumption that the Soviets had prompted the Korean War led policymakers to the conclusion that the Soviets were ready for a "hot" war with the West.

0,The Korean peninsula, like Poland and the Rhineland, has been the victim of its place on the globe for centuries. The "land of the morning calm," as it is traditionally known, has often found itself at the center of conflicts between China, Japan and Russia. The few short years after the end of WWII were no exception. After the surrender of Japan in 1945, a hastily-put-together agreement directed Japanese forces north of the country's 38th parallel to surrender to the Russians. Those south of the line were to surrender to the Americans. As was the case in postwar Europe, the Soviet Union moved quickly to establish a communist dictatorship in its area of influence. This spur-of-the-moment agreement settled nothing and led to several armed clashes between North and South Korea from 1948 to 1950. During this time, massive amounts of Soviet military hardware were funneled to the North, the majority of which was clearly suited for offensive operations. By the decade's end, the balance of power had shifted to the North.

These techniques, practiced by the colonists and the British, protected communications vital to the commanders. They disguised information needed to plan strategy, report the enemy's capabilities, and provide warnings. Solving and reading the enemy's secret messages also proved critical. Not only did it reveal the enemy's intentions, but a few even revealed American traitors.

What's surprising is not the extent of this vulnerability, but that it has manifested itself in ways that haven't yet had dramatic, society-wide effects, although the Atlanta example is surely a good scare. I suspect we all fear that far more crippling and dangerous cyber incidents are likely in our future, since malicious activity is relatively easy and the increasing pace of connected technology simply increases the target size.

The 60th Signal Service Company out of Fort Lewis, Washington, did not arrive in Korea until 9 October 1950 and did not start operations until 16 October. There were two groups on the ground in Korea in the early days of war: the Air Force Security Service and a South Korean SIGINT group working with an American civilian named Nichols. These entities, however, did no analysis and concentrated mostly on intercepting and translating North Korean communications. While their work provided vital tactical intelligence to the UN effort, they simply did not have the talent and materials to handle serious long-term projects. AFSA did.

0,Mr. Rosen prepared the layout of a machine that completely duplicated the function of the Japanese machine. With his equivalent, American cryptanalysts could simply type a "Purple" cipher text into a machine and retrieve a plain text decipherment from the printer. When the U.S. later recovered parts of an actual "Purple" machine, it was discovered that Japan, itself, had used stepping switches for their original device. Mr. Rosen had duplicated a machine he had never seen.

0,Beginning shortly after the American attack at Inchon, North Korean communications begin to trace the northern and western retreat of the KPA from the Pusan Perimeter zone. Some moved back to Kwangju by train, although there was an unspecified accident en route that killed three and wounded nineteen. In mid-September North Korean forces reported from Kumch'on that the situation of the battalion was not good and that ammunition was needed. There were indications that at least some of the forces in Kumch'on were ordered to pull back to Taejon. North Korean hospitals were moving their patients to safer areas, and the different unit headquarters were shifting north. Warm winter clothing could not be delivered to the North Korean troops in the mountains in the southern part of the Korean peninsula, and the soldiers were getting sick. Obviously the Americans and their allies were gaining the upper hand.

After the Arab-Israeli War in 1967, the capture of the in 1968, and the shootdown of a Navy EC-121 reconnaissance aircraft in 1969, Morrison, as ADP, found that it was almost impossible to coordinate an NSA rapid response. This was due principally to the physical separation of the analytical elements involved. In July 1969, Morrison proposed to the Director of NSA (DIRNSA) that a single National SIGINT watch center be established. DIRNSA concurred and charged Morrison with establishing the center. Identifying space and solving staffing and communications issues took longer than anticipated. Despite the obstacles, the center was activated with a formal charter in late 1972.

0,On August 4, 1945, Soviet school children gave a carving of the Great Seal of the United States to U.S. Ambassador Averell Harriman. It hung in the ambassador's Moscow residential office until 1952 when the State Department discovered that it was 'bugged.' The microphone hidden inside was passive and only activated when the Soviets wanted it to be. They shot radio waves from a van parked outside into the ambassador's office and could then detect the changes of the microphone's diaphragm inside the resonant cavity. When Soviets turned off the radio waves it was virtually impossible to detect the hidden 'bug.' The Soviets were able to eavesdrop on the U.S. ambassador's conversations for six years. The replica on display in the Museum was molded from the original after it came to NSA for testing. The exhibit can be opened to reveal a copy of the microphone and the resonant cavity inside.

0,SIGINT proved vital to the American efforts around the Pusan Perimeter. It gave General Walker some warning of the North Korean troop movements and allowed him to position his forces accordingly. When the North Korean onslaught began to waver, SIGINT gave the initial indications of these weaknesses and allowed Walker to track their retreat from the Pusan area after the UN attack on Inchon. On 24 August 1950, a memo appeared from the chief, Office of Operations, detailing the important intelligence that AFSA had provided the troops on the ground in Korea. The memo stated that AFSA had "confirmed the identification" of several North Korean infantry divisions as well as identified several previously unknown units; provided "the first evidence of the corps structure of the North Korean Army;" provided advance warning of enemy troop movements around the Pusan Perimeter; reported on the location and construction of airfields and the planes at them; located "supply and distribution centers for artillery ammunition"; reported evidence that North Korean supplies were running low; and provided information on the health and morale of the North Korean troops. This priceless support continued through the entire campaign and beyond.

0,The SIGSALY system was inaugurated on 15 July 1943 in a conference between London and the Pentagon (the original plan had called for one of the terminals to be installed in the White House, but Roosevelt, aware of Churchill's penchant for calling at all hours of the night, had decided to have the Washington terminal moved to the Pentagon with extensions to the White House and the Navy Department building.) In London, the bulk of the SIGSALY equipment was stored in the basement of Selfridges Department Store, with an extension to Churchill's war room, approximately a mile away. With the coming of SIGSALY, the shortcomings of the less than effective A-3 were now a thing of the past. The Deutsche Reichspost began to notice that the Allied signals on the A-3 system had been drastically reduced, prompting the chief engineer of the Dutch intercept site to conclude that "there was another telephone connection in use between the United States and England." The two-pronged "provide and protect" strategy of the Allied cryptologic services was slowly beginning to produce results. Both sides of the effort began to sense that the goal of intercepting and decoding Axis traffic, while at the same time protecting their own communications from exploitation, was in reach.

Their translations were invaluable, but, once the work was completed, a Navy officer had to further render their classical expressions into naval jargon.

0,By month's end, the North Korean offensive had forced the U.S. 8th Army into a defensive position 50 by 90 miles long, surrounding the vital port of Pusan. The area quickly became known as the "Pusan Perimeter." The action provided some brief relief from the July onslaughts, but 8th Army commander General Walton H. Walker's situation was extremely tenuous. Despite the difficult position of his forces, he was committed to holding the line and avoiding a Korean version of the defeat of the Allies at Dunkirk in 1940. In that engagement, Hitler's Blitzkrieg had forced the remnants of the British Army to the French coast and forced them to flee back across the English Channel. But Pusan would not be another Dunkirk. Like many past American commanders in critical situations, Walker would have the twin resources of effective signals intelligence (SIGINT) to assist him in making the right moves in keeping the perimeter secure and sound communications security (COMSEC) to protect his own communications from being exploited.

This intelligence enabled the commanding general of the U.S. 5th Air Force to ensure that the raid was met with ample defense. One YAK and two IL-10 bombers were downed, several others were damaged, and two MiG fighters were also damaged. It is believed that the commander of the 5th Air Force may have been aware of the impending raid before the commander of the North Korean attacking unit had received his orders.

In early 1941, when became the Officer in Charge (OIC) of Station HYPO, Dyer remained as assistant OIC and chief cryptanalyst. Under Dyer's supervision, HYPO began contributing essential elements of information derived from the JN-25 code to Admiral Nimitz before the Battle of the Coral Sea. By 27 May 1942, HYPO had developed such a detailed picture of the Japanese plan for the occupation of Midway that Nimitz's intelligence officer was able to predict almost precisely when and where the enemy would strike. Dyer was also directly involved with the interception, decryption, and subsequent intelligence information reporting which led to the shootdown and death of Fleet Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. Dyer's work also resulted in the breaking of the Japanese merchant shipping and transport code and the main Japanese weather code.

0,The British, led by Alan Turing, built on the initial Polish successes, but faced a more serious challenge. Just before the war began, the Germans increased the number of rotors they could choose from to select the three they would use each day, increasing the possible variations that had to be dealt with. Turing is considered one of the two or three best mathematicians of the twentieth century, and spent the entire war working in cryptanalysis. He and his colleagues used their mathematical skills to improve on a machine the Poles had first built called a "bombe" that enabled the British to compare, in a relatively rapid fashion, the numerous possible keys with portions of messages they thought the Germans were sending. Success was neither total nor assured, but the British and later the Americans were able to read enough German messages to provide great assistance to their armed forces and helped them defeat Nazi Germany.

By 29 June, new traffic was arriving hourly in the analytic offices between 0800 and 1630, Washington, D.C., time. Analysts now worked on a twenty-four-hour schedule with maximum efforts occurring during the regular work hours and an operational watch at night. The additional personnel required to perform the analysis on this extended schedule were pulled from a variety of places. Analysts working on very low priority problems were transferred to the Korean target. Other analysts were borrowed from AFSA's technical consultants branch. To fill the desperate need for keypunch operators, training school students waiting for their clearances were tapped to do the punch work, but significant precautions were taken to prevent them from finding out the nature and purpose of their work. Any linguist with any experience in the Korean language was assigned to the problem. Strenuous efforts were made to locate Korean-English dictionaries and to formulate working aids. Further, steps were taken to increase the personnel and money at AFSA.

0,The Museum exhibit highlights how one decoded message changed the course of history during World War I. The Germans planned to cut off supply lines to Britain and France by beginning unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic. Fearing the United States would join the battle if their ships were sunk, Germany asked Mexico to start a war with the United States and promised the return of Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. The request was sent from the foreign minister in Berlin, Arthur Zimmermann, through the German ambassador in Washington, D.C., to the German ambassador in Mexico City, in the form of a coded message. It became known as "The Zimmermann Telegram." Britain intercepted the message as it was transmitted overseas. Royal Navy cryptanalysts decoded and showed the message to the United States. Ultimately, Congress declared war on Germany. Thus, a single coded message, and the efforts of cryptanalysts, changed history.

0,After WWII, huge portions of the U.S. government's war-making machinery were cut back to a bare minimum. U.S. SIGINT activities, despite their proven usefulness, did not escape these budget reductions. In 1949, in an effort to cull the most benefit from the remaining resources, all three military cryptologic services were centralized under the new Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA). In addition to AFSA, the Army Security Agency and Air Force Security Service continued to play an important role. Prior to the North Korean attack, at the behest of the policymakers in Washington, AFSA and its partners focused almost exclusively on the Cold War challenges posed by the Soviet Union and China. Their justified preoccupation with the communist threat prevented them from properly covering secondary targets, to include Korea. At the time of the 25 June attack, there was only one traffic analyst working on North Korean communications. AFSA had no Korean typewriters, books on the Korean language, nor Korean dictionaries. After the attack, however, the cryptologic community began to rise to the challenge. By October, Korean intercept positions had been increased from two to twenty-three. By late July, enemy intercepts were being processed on a 24-hour basis and crucial North Korean command and control networks had been identified.

0,In the late 90s Alberta had legislation that required measurement of performance around various types of biota. However, the province needed a comprehensive system to actually do that. The reality of growing demand for Alberta’s resources, from forest products to oil and gas, and the associated population growth, resulted in an Alberta landscape in transformation. To make informed decisions, Albertans needed to understand how increased land use was affecting Alberta’s species and ecosystems. The question facing the ABMI’s founding scientists was, “Rather than look at impacts on a few select species and their habitats in a particular area, how can we evaluate the combined effect of various human activities on Alberta’s natural environments more broadly?”  In other words, they asked themselves, what does a regional cumulative effects biodiversity monitoring program need to look like? Their goal: design a rigorous system effective at provincial and regional scales that can detect and track changes in Alberta’s ecosystems if and when changes occur.

The Washington, D.C., end of the system was installed in the recently completed Pentagon in the summer of 1943.

0,On 15 September, MacArthur, despite strong opposition from advisers, conducted a brilliant amphibious landing at the port of Inch'on. Landing well behind North Korean lines. The combined U.S. Army and Marine units involved in the operation delivered a decisive and crushing blow to the enemy offensive. During the same period (September 15-27) Walker's 8th Army seized the opportunity and broke out of its embattled position within the perimeter to join the attack. North Korea was now on the defensive. Through the use of SIGINT, the coalition forces tracked the haphazard retreat of enemy forces. Operations were going so well that some predicted that the war would be over by Christmas.

Biodiversity is a very broad concept that incorporates cumulative effects management, wildlife conservation, and ecological goods and services, among others. There is increasing awareness of a global incentive to conserve biodiversity, at the heart of which lies the fundamental intent of sustaining and ensuring the wellbeing of our environmental systems and the continuation of life on earth. At more local scales, achieving this collective goal requires predictable and scientifically credible monitoring to better understand the state of our ecosystems, our role as a society in maintaining biodiversity, and the consequences of action or non-action.

0,Fortunately, the technical groundwork for a solution was already in place. About 1936, Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL) started exploring a technique to transform voice signals into digital data which could then be reconstructed (or synthesized) into intelligible voice. It was called a "vocoder," short for voice coder. An early demonstration of the voice synthesizer portion of the vocoder was even a part of the 1939 World's Fair in New York. The approaching war stimulated the investigation of true voice security. The BTL staff soon discovered that there were about eighty patents issued on the general topic, but analysis indicated that all of the methods were really unsatisfactory from a national security viewpoint. New technology was required. Spurred on by added interest from the U.K. and some early research results, the vocoder was selected as the basis of a new high-tech voice security system. BTL proceeded on its own to develop this much-needed capability and was soon able to demonstrate it to the satisfaction of the Army. A U. S. Army contract was awarded in 1942 for the production of the first two systems. This system eventually came to be called SIGSALY and was first deployed in 1943.

0,The U.S. SIGINT world after World War II was one of departing personnel and budget cuts. At the end of the war, United States military personnel desperately wanted to return to civilian life and their families. They deluged American newspapers and their congressmen with pleas to be demobilized quickly so they could return to a "normal" life. Their successful campaign led Congress to drastically reduce the size of the U.S. armed forces over the next few years. The army, for example, went from over 12.1 million personnel in August 1945 to somewhat over one million by July 1947. All SIGINT operations suffered from this significant loss of personnel, especially those that relied heavily on men and women in uniform. Even though stellar analysts like Solomon Kullback and Frank Rowlett remained, a large number of personnel left cryptology at the end of World War II.

0,The USSR was a "denied" area, that is to say, travel within its territory for foreigners (or even its own citizenry) was severely restricted. Obtaining reliable information about the country or its military capabilities was difficult, if not impossible, through conventional intelligence methods. In response to this need, defense policymakers established a national program of reconnaissance, carried out by the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Army also engaged in aerial reconnaissance, but usually in support of tactical objectives, as it did during the Vietnam War.

0,This exhibit displays the critical work of Native American Code Talkers during World War I and World War II. Having suffered losses in the First World War as a result of the Germans listening to U.S. communications, a company commander of the U.S. Army's 142nd Infantry Regiment found a solution. Captain Lawrence overheard two Choctaws speaking in their own language. He arranged for them to become radio communicators. They used common words to replace military terms and spoke Choctaw, thus becoming the first Code Talkers. On October 26, 1918, in northern France's Argonne Forest, the Choctaws' communications resulted in a completely successful surprise attack against the Germans. The Army continued the program and during World War II recruited Comanches, Choctaws, Kiowas, Winnebagos, Seminoles, Navajos, Hopis, Cherokees, and others. The Marine Corps took the Army work and codified, expanded, refined, and perfected it into a true security discipline, using Navajos exclusively.

0,The public and private sectors will need to take a holistic approach to addressing privacy concerns associated with our increasing reliance on digital technologies. Similar to the way that new drugs must be reviewed and approved for safety and efficacy before they come to market, perhaps we need laws or regulations requiring review of privacy and cybersecurity safeguards in new connected products before they can be made available to the public. Perhaps, as in Europe, we need stronger notice and consent requirements to regulate how our personal information can be used, shared, or disseminated online. Or perhaps, in some industries, we need to mandate the adoption of low-tech redundancies to safeguard against the loss or manipulation of personal information stored online. This need not necessarily entail government regulation, as industry-generated approaches might be sufficient - but my point is simply that we must have a societal dialogue about how we want to confront the problem.

0,However, fixing responsibility for the debacle at Pearl Harbor was complicated by the revelations about the MAGIC decryptions. MAGIC was the covername assigned to the intelligence garnered from the decryptions and translations of Japanese diplomatic messages. From mid-1940 until the attack on Pearl Harbor, American cryptologists had read the most sensitive Japanese diplomatic messages and had kept President Roosevelt informed of every Japanese diplomatic and political policy turn. But MAGIC didn't tell Roosevelt and other government leaders what the Japanese military was planning. Those ciphers and codes had largely resisted the efforts of American cryptologists to break them. Any investigation of the Pearl Harbor disaster would be as much a revelation of what we DIDN'T know as of what we DID know.

0,In August 1950, the war in Korea was not going well for General Walton H. Walker and the U.S. 8th Army. The inexperienced soldiers were trapped by North Koreans in a small corner of South Korea known in the press as the Pusan Perimeter. Supplies were limited and morale was very low. In this desperate time, General Walker had a weapon - a secret weapon - that would help save the day: signals intelligence (SIGINT) from the Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA) and the service cryptologic organizations.

0,During the 1930s, Rowlett and his colleagues, after a lengthy period of training, worked as both cryptologists and cryptanalysts. They compiled codes and ciphers for use by the U.S. Army and began solving a number of foreign systems, notably Japanese. In the mid-1930s, Rowlett and his colleagues solved the first Japanese machine system for encipherment of diplomatic communications, known to the Americans as RED. From 1939-40, Rowlett played a major role in solving a much more sophisticated Japanese diplomatic cipher machine, nicknamed PURPLE by the U.S. When asked what his greatest contribution to this effort was, Rowlett once said, "I was the one who believed it could be done."

0,This case highlights one of the major limitations in applying Fourth Amendment jurisprudence in the digital era to which I wish to draw your attention. Courts are limited to deciding only the case or controversy before them based upon the set of facts presented, and properly so. But because of the manner in which courts must evaluate cyber devices, our privacy laws in this area are generally backward looking, and intuitively, that feels like the wrong approach when addressing a rapidly developing technology. By contrast, that approach does make sense in, say, the area of tort liability. Law students will recall that Mrs. Palsgraf's injuries on a Long Island Railroad platform were said by Justice Benjamin Cardozo to not be "proximately caused" by the negligence of railway guards. Think about how that legal concept has been applied in the decades since then. Clearly, in the case of tort law, specific cases can yield general principles that are of considerable utility in application to future, but very different, facts.

0,By the fall of 1941, the COMINT services in the U.S. military -- the Signal Intelligence Service for the Army and OP-20-G for the Navy -- both had small but vigorous programs with experienced personnel to exploit Japanese communications. The Army and Navy shared the processing of diplomatic messages -- decrypted from the Japanese PURPLE machine and codenamed MAGIC -- and were making efforts, so far mostly unsuccessful, against Japanese naval or military communications. American cryptologists, working with their British counterparts, had made some recoveries in a general purpose Japanese cryptosystem nicknamed JN-25, but, by late 1941, several basic changes to the system had foiled cryptanalysis and exploitation. The U.S. Navy was following the movements of major Japanese fleet elements by means of traffic analysis and Direction Finding from a series of sites around the Pacific.

0,Hill 395 was located at a strategic point in central Korea, and its loss would have endangered other UN positions in that region. In October 1952, the Chinese attacked the hill, which was defended largely by ROK Army units, with U.S. artillery and air support and French infantry. A standard history of the Korean War notes that "pre-battle preparation, made possible by effective intelligence, added to well-trained troops, skillfully employed, and backed by coordinated air, armor, and artillery support, demonstrated what might be accomplished on defense."
0,During this desperate time, the SIGINT reports contained interesting and significant information that was very useful in efforts to keep the U.S. operations successful. For example, a few of the messages detailed locations of several North Korean infantry battalions. Additional intercept provided a listing of the ammunition being delivered to the 1st Division after what they had previously held was destroyed by the Americans. Several messages discussed a serious radio outage, which prevented an unidentified unit from talking to anyone except the North Korean 6th Division. One message revealed North Korean intelligence on the Americans and South Koreans. North Korean air force messages described the construction of new runways and some sort of shelters, believed at the time to be underground hangars.

0,Finally, Mrs. Friedman left her mark on the life of one of espionage's most notorious spies, Velvalee Dickinson, whose path to and role in espionage are noteworthy. Following high school and some college, she married the head of a brokerage firm that had Japanese-American clients. The Dickinson's interest in Japan grew so much that they joined the Japanese-American Society, where they began to rub shoulders with members of the Japanese consulate. When the brokerage firm's success suffered a downturn, so too did the Dickinson's role as proponents of good Japanese-American relations. At some point, the couple became spies for Japan. Velvalee became a major player, and her successful doll shop was a cover for her espionage. Known as the "Doll Woman," she corresponded with Japanese agents using the names of women she found in her business correspondence.

Although high-level approval by the Army command in Washington was given for the Navy to move to Corregidor, local authorities demurred.

Arrangements were made then in 1935 to transfer the Navy site to Cavite, where it would also be protected by the fortress island of Corregidor.

0,From early in World War II, the United States and Great Britain worked to solve the problem of the German Enigma machine. The Enigma machine used a series of rotor wheels and a plug board that theoretically gave the device enciphering capabilities of 3x10 , thus convincing the Germans that the code was unbreakable. The code was eventually broken, and Germany's U-boat commander added another rotor to the machines used in his submarines to increase communications security. The United States and Great Britain then worked on solving the four-rotor Enigma. In December 1942, the British solved the four-rotor problem, allowing them to read messages with moderate delays.

0,As cyber technology has progressed, the European concept of privacy has resulted in relatively strict laws in Europe about the handling of electronic information. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which takes effect in just a few days, applies to all EU organizations, any organizations seeking to offer goods or services to EU subjects, and any companies holding or processing the personal data of people in the EU. Companies who fail to comply with the GDPR can incur penalties of up to 4% of annual global income or €million, whichever is greater. The GDPR seeks to strengthen consent rules, requiring that disclosures be clear, intelligible, and easily accessible, and that it be easy for a user to withdraw consent. It ensures the right to be forgotten, which includes erasing data and preventing its further dissemination. The law also mandates privacy by design; data protection must be designed into systems, rather than added on. If a data breach occurs, companies must provide notification regarding within 72 hours.

0,Dr. Abraham Sinkov lived in retirement in Arizona after two careers, 32 years in NSA (and its predecessors), followed by an appointment as a professor of mathematics at Arizona State University. This success had practical consequences for SIS, as well. For the first time, SIS began to garner respect from its military superiors. Once the military understood that this small organization could read sensitive messages from a potential adversary, the Signal Corps increased the SIS budget and authorized increased hiring of cryptanalysts.

0,The U.S. Army's SIGABA, called the ECM (Electric Cipher Machine) in the Navy, was the only machine system used during World War II to remain completely unbroken by an enemy. The Germans referred to the U.S. machine, SIGABA, as the 'Big' machine. It utilized the same principle of rotating, removable, wired rotor wheels that the German Enigma employed. However, unlike the stepping motion of the Enigma, the SIGABA/ECM's motion appeared to be random. It wasn't, but it was so complicated, the German's never broke it, and the Japanese gave up trying. Frank Rowlett of the Army's Signal Intelligence Service developed the complicated stepping motion.

0,We also need to consider what privacy means to us here in the US. Because we've emphasized freedom from government surveillance in our current privacy regime, and because the fact-specific legal analysis of that surveillance has focused, as discussed above, on the type and location of the surveillance, the same piece of electronic personal information may be protected from interception by the government, but could be disseminated, sold, or otherwise used by a private company with few, if any, limitations. In only narrow areas, such as HIPAA regulations for health records and Fair Credit Reporting Act requirements for financial records, do our laws focus on the type of information at issue. As I noted earlier about the absence of a focus on the content of communications, we could, for example, have a privacy scheme that was dependent in greater part on the substantive nature of communications rather than how communications are collected. To address these inconsistencies that have grown up around our legal privacy framework, we must evaluate carefully the manner in which private companies rely on connected technology to carry out their business activities. This includes considering not only how and when they collect personal information from customers, whether to store it online, and whether and to whom it should be disseminated, but also whether relying solely upon networked devices and systems is even the right choice for certain activities when particular sensitivities may be involved.

0,This exhibit celebrates three heroes of cryptology. William F. Friedman worked for the U.S. Army to make codes and took on the additional task of codebreaking. He assembled a brilliant team of cryptanalysts that broke the Japanese diplomatic cipher machines that had replaced their earlier paper codes. Friedman is regarded as the father of modern American cryptology, having pioneered in communications security and cryptanalysis, and being a great teacher of the art. What William Friedman was to the Army, Laurance Safford was to the Navy. Beginning in the mid-1920s with a staff of one (civilian cryptanalyst Agnes Driscoll), Safford assembled the nucleus of the team that broke the Japanese naval codes during World War II. George Washington, while never a codebreaker himself, recognized the value of military intelligence and used the secret arts, including codebreaking, in the epic struggle against Great Britain during the Revolutionary War.
0,Therefore, General George Marshall, Chief of Staff of the Army, and Admiral King, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Fleet, sent a memorandum to the president, asking that he order the other government agencies to discontinue their cryptologic operations.

0,The morning of December 7 found General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, facing a difficult decision. American codebreakers had deciphered Japanese diplomatic traffic that indicated Japan had given up on a political solution to its problems with the United States. This meant that the prospect of war with that nation was now a distinct possibility. With this critical information in mind, Marshall was determined that a general warning to his Pacific commands, including Hawaii, was in order; however, the quickest way to relay this potentially vital and classified information was by secure phone. At the time, the only available secure communications technology was the A-3 Scrambler system operated in New York by the American Telegraph and Telephone Co. Although the device was considered state of the art, it was based on 1920s technology and many, including Marshall, were concerned that it was not secure. Marshall's suspicions were more than on the mark. Unbeknownst to him at the time, in the fall of 1941, The Deutsche Reichspost, the German organization tasked with handling telephone and telegraph traffic, had broken the A-3.

0,On 25 June 1950, in an attempt to unify the peninsula on their own terms, the North struck across the 38th parallel in a series of well-orchestrated attacks. The South Korean army, with practically no air or antitank capability, was no match for the Soviet-manufactured T-34 tanks and North Korean infantry. By the end of the first week of the war, 40,000 South Korean soldiers had been killed, captured, or declared missing in action. On 27 June, President Truman, supported by a UN resolution, announced that he was ordering U.S forces to support the South Koreans. Three days later, he appointed General Douglas MacArthur commander of the UN forces, and authorized him to commit ground forces to the conflict. Korea had been a mere afterthought for many of the policymakers in Washington. Up until the time of the attack, the troubled nation had been considered outside of the newly established defense lines of the Cold War. The first units to be committed consisted of several U.S. divisions under MacArthur's command, which had been pulling occupation duty in Japan. Going to war was the last thing they were expecting. Once on the ground they found themselves facing a well-equipped and well-trained adversary. Despite their best efforts, one defeat followed another. The North Korean war machine continued to roll south, with the now-realistic goal of driving the coalition forces off the peninsula for good.

Wir haben die Tage vor der Gruppenphase erfolgreich genutzt um unsere Roboter für den Wettkampf vorzubereiten. In der Gruppenphase haben wir dann die Ergebnisse der Arbeit an unserer Hard- und Software im letzten Jahr gründlich getestet. Dabei sind ein paar Probleme bei der Kommunikation zwischen einzelnen Softwareteilen aufgetreten, aber am Ende haben die Komponenten erfolgreich miteinander kommuniziert. Unsere Hardware hat uns sehr erfreut, denn nach unserer Arbeit am Kabelmanagement, konnten wir nur ein kaputtes Kabel finden und mussten insgesamt auch verhältnismäßig wenig Zeit auf Hardware Probleme aufwenden. Zugegebenermaßen war unsere Qualifikation für das Halbfinale nur knapp erreicht, aber schlußendlich haben wir nach einem spannenden letzten Spiel gegen den amtierenden Weltmeister es geschafft das Halbfinale zu erreichen. Fertig sind wir aber noch nicht, das Halbfinale steht unmittelbar bevor und die letzten Vorkehrungen laufen bereits auf Hochtouren um unsere Chancen auf das Finale zu maximieren.

0,Whether we applaud it or not, the European, Japanese and other nations' movement toward comprehensive privacy regulation forces everyone in this digitally connected world to consider how we are going to reconcile different notions of privacy. We've been persistent in scrutinizing government intrusion into our daily lives - which is certainly a worthy focus - but have we done so at the expense of our personal dignity or the integrity of our private information, particularly given the rapid pace of technological development? Some might say that Europe's approach is better suited to manage the privacy challenges posed by the digital age. Let me make crystal clear that the NSA is not, and I am not, advocating for diminished privacy protections or an increased ability to conduct surveillance. Rather, we at NSA feel duty bound to discuss these types of issues, and we'd like to do so transparently and openly to help reach a consensus as to the best approach.

This rebuilding was reflected in the messages intercepted during this period.

Follow-up communications revealed that most of the ammunition ordered by the various North Korean entities was delivered sometime around 25 August. Another message ordered river-crossing equipment to be delivered to the KPA 1st Corps by 23 August. Another described the changes of disposition of several regiments and battalions. Additionally, North Korean communications described plans to organize a rear reconnaissance unit whose mission was to annihilate the enemy in fire raids.

Established by a Joint Congressional Resolution, this investigation promised to be the most thorough possible. The Truman administration released all of the relevant classified documents, including the MAGIC translations. All of the participants still alive, with the exception of the seriously ill Secretary of War Stimson, were examined. In 1946 the committee's findings were released in forty volumes. A single volume report contained twelve findings that apportioned the blame among all the principals: Hawaiian area commanders and the War and Navy Departments. A minority report also censured Roosevelt but concluded, like the majority findings, that Secretary Stimson, Secretary Knox, Generals Marshall and Gerow, and Admiral Stark, as well as General Short and Admiral Kimmel, were culpable for the disaster.

0,Safford promoted collaboration with the Army on several fronts, and was largely responsible for the Navy entry into a joint effort with the Army on the Japanese diplomatic systems. He recognized the signs of war that appeared in the diplomatic traffic, and tried to get a warning message to Pearl Harbor several days before the attack, but was rebuffed by Admiral Noyes, the director of Naval communication. Organizationally, he promoted a decentralized system with Naval COMINT sections in Washington, Hawaii and Manila. He gave the chief Japanese naval code problem to the organization in Hawaii, and named the brilliant Joseph Rochefort to head the effort. (He also gave Rochefort a blank check to obtain the very best Navy cryptanalysts.) This paid off in the spring of 1942 when Rochefort's team broke JN-25, the main Japanese naval operational code, in time to win the battle of Midway. But disputes over organization eventually led to Safford's ouster, and he was shunted to the side for the remainder of the war. He retired from active duty in 1953 and died in May 1973.

Sinkov and his colleagues had been shown Bletchley Park, the secret headquarters for British cryptology, and exchanged information on German and Japanese systems. It is still unclear how much the American delegation was told about British success against the German ENIGMA machine, but Sinkov later recalled that they were told about the ENIGMA problem only a short while before the delegation was to leave, and that details were sketchy. Nevertheless, the mission to the UK was a success overall and helped give U.S.-UK cryptologic relations a strong practical foundation.

0,Eventually a dozen SIGSALY terminals were distributed to the far corners of the globe, to include Washington; London; Algiers; Australia; Hawaii; Oakland, California; Paris (after its liberation); Guam; and, after VE Day, in Frankfurt and Berlin. Most interesting perhaps was the installation of the device on a 250-ton ship, an ocean lighter dubbed OL-31. This floating communications network tracked General Douglas MacArthur in his island hopping campaign in the Pacific, and would have been a vital communications link if had it been necessary to conduct a full fledged invasion of Japan. Most importantly, the network provided both military and civilian leaders access to secure voice communications. The SIGSALY was vital in protecting both discussions of significant issues and day-to-day administrative details of the war. All told, over 3,000 top-secret conferences were held using SIGSALY, a truly impressive statistic. Once again, Allied ingenuity and hard work had won the day. The best proof perhaps is a telling 1943 statement by the once successful Deutsche Reichspost on the future possibilities of intercept of high-level Allied communications, "there is not much to be gotten from them now."

0,This exhibit celebrates the important role that cryptology played during the American Civil War. During America's first century, secret writing — cryptography — figured in many instances in which lives and fortunes were at stake and confidentiality was desired. Until nearly the middle of the 19th century, large armies moved over an extensive battlefield unassisted by any special technology to aid long distance communications or even tactical communications. In 1844, Samuel F. B. Morse successfully tested his improved electromagnetic telegraph between Washington and Baltimore. At the time of the American Civil War, both sides began encrypting high-level messages to be transmitted on the telegraph. Both sides established cipher bureaus in their respective capitals to work on enemy encrypted messages, one of the early examples of a centralized intelligence activity in the United States.

0,The GRAB II (Galactic Radiation And Background) satellite depicts one of the earliest signals intelligence satellites launched by the U.S. Government. The first GRAB satellite was launched on June 22, 1960, following the loss in May of the U-2 spy plane flown by Gary Powers. The successful launch of the GRAB II satellite occurred on June 29, 1961. The GRAB satellites had a dual mission. The unclassified mission was to gather solar radiation data. The secret mission gathered radar pulses within a specific bandwidth from Soviet equipment. The data was then downloaded to ground stations, recorded on magnetic tape, and couriered to the NRL, whose engineers had designed and built GRAB. Following initial analysis, the tapes were duplicated and sent to Strategic Air Command and the National Security Agency (NSA). Based on the information NSA received, analysts determined that the Soviets had radars that supported the capability to destroy ballistic missiles.

0,The final push by UN forces out of the Pusan Perimeter was made possible by the UN attack on Inchon, a port city about thirty miles west of Seoul. This surprise amphibious assault was the brainchild of General MacArthur. He felt that such an attack would "catch the enemy by surprise, outflank them, trap them between UN forces to the north and to the south, and obviate the need for the alternative: a long, bloodier, counteroffensive straight up the peninsula." The plan was considered extremely risky by the Joint Chiefs and President Truman. These concerns were apparently well founded, as an examination of the North Korean communications reveals. As early as 6 September, there were messages revealing North Korean suspicions of a planned UN amphibious assault on a port city on the western coast of South Korea. Communications over the next eight days indicated the detection of enemy (American) plans to attack Mokp'o, Kunsan, or Inchon. There was at least one message requesting verification of a rumored American landing at Mokp'o prior to the Inchon attack. The 10 September U.S. bombing of Inchon further heightened fears, and rapid preparations were made for the defense of Inchon in order to prevent enemy landings ashore.

Thomas Jefferson described a similar device for the English language in his writings, and it is sometimes referred to as the "Jefferson Cipher Wheel." However, the connection to Thomas Jefferson remains unproven. Jefferson's design was probably based upon an unnamed earlier device. The device uses scrambled alphabets on the edges of each wheel to cipher a message. By aligning the plain text letters in one row, any other row can be selected as the cipher text. The wheels are individually numbered and can be placed on the spindle in any prearranged order. This particular artifact is thought to be the oldest extant true cipher device in the world. It was apparently for use with the French language, the world's diplomatic language used through World War I.

0,We were the first to present a proof for the probabilistic completeness of RRT-based algorithms when planning with constraints on end-effector pose. If the manifold of valid configurations corresponding to the pose constraint has non-zero measure in the C-space, it is straightforward to show that algorithms like CBiRRT are probabilistically complete. This is because random sampling in the C-space will eventually place samples inside of the manifold.  However, pose constraints can also induce lower-dimensional constraint manifolds in the configuration space, making rejection sampling techniques infeasible. Sampling-based algorithms such as CBiRRT can overcome this problem by using the sample-project method: sampling coupled with a projection operator to move configuration space samples onto the constraint manifold. Before our work, it was not known whether the sample-project method produces adequate coverage of the constraint manifold to guarantee probabilistic completeness. Our proof guarantees probabilistic completeness for a class of RRT-based  algorithms given an appropriate projection operator.  This proof is valid for constraint manifolds of any fixed dimensionality.

Even so, the accessibility of RetroArch means that blind users of Windows, MacOS, and Linux can enjoy the state of the art in video game accessibility through emulation.

0,Walker stationed his forces in small manned points along the perimeter to provide an early warning and some initial defense in the case of attack, fading back in the case of a major assault. Although the number of troops available to him was growing, Walker could not afford to do more at this point. During the first two-thirds of August, Walker faced uncoordinated attacks on four fronts: at the Naktong Bulge, around Taegu from two directions (north and east), and in a northeastern sector around Yongdok, Changsa-dong and Pohang-dong. The battle became a "daily succession of crises" in which Walker had to rush his men to various points along the perimeter to stop the North Koreans. SIGINT was vital to his efforts at this time because it provided him with an indication of the enemy's movements and plans and allowed him to spread his men as effectively as possible to repel the KPA.

0,Jeremy Kerr is an ecologist and conservation biologist with a passion for bringing his research into the public arena to help engage with society and policymakers. Kerr’s PhD at York University (was awarded the 1999 Governor General’s Gold Medal, and it included publications in Nature, Conservation Biology, and Global Ecology and Biogeography). Kerr discovered the extent to which climate and land uses limit many Canadian species, and showed that species respond predictably to climate and land use changes. His PhD work launched an NSERC postdoc at Oxford with Lord Robert May (UK chief scientific advisor and President of the Royal Society) and Sir Richard Southwood. His postdoctoral, and then uOttawa, research expanded rapidly beyond macroecological and conservation biological foundations, leading to recognition that modern, human-caused climate change is effectively a global experiment on validity of core ecological theories (published in Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Conservation Biology, etc.). Kerr showed that species across Canada are shifting toward northern wilderness areas and tracking rapid climate changes. This helped make the case for wilderness conservation in Canada and he has supported public outreach, media and policy efforts behind significant governmental commitments to conserve large wilderness areas in the northern boreal.

It also was one of the earliest applications of spread spectrum technology, which was key to its effective operation.

Consisting of 40 racks of equipment, it weighed over 50 tons, and featured two turntables which were synchronized on both the sending and the receiving end by an agreed upon timing signal from the U.S. Naval Observatory. (For a more detailed explanation of the engineering aspects of SIGSALY, see J.V. Boone and R.R. Peterson's work, , NSA Center for Cryptologic History, Ft. George G. Meade, Md.)

In June 1942, the Japanese had hoped to surprise the American military on Midway Island and claim this crucial location. However, American Navy cryptologists stationed in Hawaii had made some breaks into the Japanese Navy Fleet Code, known to cryptanalysts as JN-25B.

0,The opportunity to do research in pediatric chronic illness with Dr. Ed Wagner brought me to Group Health in 1994, and I've been at the Research Institute in one way or another ever since. I joined GHP (now the Washington Permanente Medical Group) as a pediatrician and medical director in 2011. An integrated health system like ours that provides care and coverage, partners with a multispecialty medical group, and aligns all parts of the system to do what's right for patients—this kind of system is our best hope for solving the health care crisis in the US. I was born in Boston to Argentine immigrants and was raised in a multi-generational Spanish-speaking home. My husband and I moved to Seattle almost 30 years ago for what was supposed to be a three-year stint as residents in pediatrics (me) and internal medicine (him). We loved it here and stayed. Despite being East Coast transplants, we've managed to raise three truly Pacific Northwest kids. I enjoy hiking, open water swimming, and boisterous kitchen table conversations.

0,The KPA continued to force U.S. troops and their allies southward until the end of July. Because of his green troops and equipment shortages, General Walker decided to establish a defensive line, retreat behind it, and hold it at all cost. The Pusan Perimeter, as the line came to be called, was an area in the southeast corner of South Korea bounded by the Naktong River on the west, the Sea of Japan on the east, rugged mountains on the north, and the Korea Strait on the south. The perimeter enclosed the port city of Pusan, where U.S. troops and supplies were arriving, as well as the city of Taegu, where General Walker set up his 8th Army Headquarters. This defensive perimeter was established on 31 July 1950 when the last U.S. soldiers crossed the Naktong River. It was held by the U.S. troops for approximately forty-five days until the Inchon campaign provided enough of a distraction that Walker's forces could push across the Naktong River and drive the North Koreans north.

0,The Museum display includes photographs of American citizens who gave information to the Soviet KGB, replicas of the messages revealing the espionage, and some World War II-era artifacts similar to those used by KGB officers. The Rosenbergs case was controversial, partly due to the accusation and conviction of Ethel Rosenberg. VENONA messages indicate that her husband, Julius, was heavily involved in providing information to his KGB handler. At least one message shows that Ethel may have known about her husband's activities. Ethel's brother, David Greenglass, was also involved, selling details about the atomic bomb project in Los Alamos where he worked. It was David's testimony against his sister and brother-in-law that led to the conviction of the Rosenbergs for conspiracy to commit espionage.

0,In his book , Clay Blair states that "As a result of the effort directed toward Moscow and elsewhere, North Korean codes had of necessity been grossly neglected" by AFSA. Further, General Walker "had no flow of 'strategic' enemy radio traffic from Washington to assist him. What he got he had to acquire locally. . . ." In truth, AFSA was a major contributor to the intelligence on North Korean operations, providing, among other things, the "flow of strategic enemy radio traffic" that probably saved Walker and the 8th Army on the Pusan Perimeter. Although it is true that North Korean communications were given only token attention before the war, talented AFSA analysts quickly started studying them after the initial assault, delivering intelligence to customers in a matter of a few weeks. Overcoming budget and personnel shortages, AFSA provided valuable information to numerous entities, including the Army Security Agency Pacific (ASAPAC) and American troops in the field, that would have otherwise been unavailable. With few other intelligence sources relating to North Korea available, SIGINT proved vital to the U.S. military efforts in the first months and throughout the war.

Conspiracies to suppress intelligence by Churchill, Roosevelt, and others would be "exposed." Other historians would "discover" new intelligence that existed which would have saved Pearl Harbor. However, the phoenix-like nature of the Pearl Harbor controversy proved only what one of Admiral Kimmel's lawyers wrote to him in 1953: "Pearl Harbor never dies, and no living person has seen the end of it."

0,The Museum displays the flag that flew at the time of the attack of the U.S.S. a U.S. Naval Ship, on June 8, 1967, when the ship found itself in the middle of the 1967 Arab-Israeli Six-Day War. Cruising 25 miles off the Gaza coast, it was attacked by Israeli fighters and torpedo boats at 2 o'clock on a clear and sunny day. There was no apparent provocation, and the reason for the attack has never been fully resolved, although Israel described it as an identification error and sent restitution for the damage and loss of life. The U.S. government accepted the explanation of the Israeli government concerning the identification error. The loss of 34 men was the largest loss of life in a single event in American cryptologic history. It occurred, ironically, during a war in which the United States was not a participant.

The embargo brought U.S.-Japanese relations to the crisis point -- and it had the opposite effect it was intended to have.

0,Since arriving at uOttawa, Kerr pioneered the first Canada-wide analyses of the factors that cause species to become endangered, discoveries that assist in establishing regional priorities for improving endangered species recovery. Species at risk are concentrated in agricultural regions in populated areas, making these areas the first frontier for conservation. Kerr’s contributions have extended to assisting with development of scientific consensus statements to improve endangered species legislation in Ontario and to protect existing legislation federally. These efforts, among many others, helped get Ontario’s new endangered species legislation passed, perhaps the strongest legislation in North America. Kerr has worked hard to communicate discoveries emerging from his research program in a way that resonates with Canadians and policy makers. This extends to participating as a speaker at the Stand Up For Science rally on Parliament Hill, a quite different form of communication. Kerr is the Vice President of the Canadian Society for Ecology and Evolution and its President-elect, and has been elected as a Visiting Senior Research Fellow at Oxford.

0,Before I spoke with Nirav at Pirimid Tech I had struggled to find the right balance of resources in my dev team. I’d committed to engineer a world-class FX EMS on the cloud using a modern web stack, but I’d also inherited a Java GUI of equal importance to our success. The two technologies make strange bedfellows. I was anxious that I would face either: coercing developers to cross-code outside of their comfort zone or hiring two very different teams. Neither prospect was practical nor cost effective. Nirav suggested a partnership with Pirimid Tech in India, in which he would provide much of the Java Swing talent that I need thus freeing my team in London to focus on web and cloud development. I participate in vetting Nirav’s team members to ensure I get the right blend of skills at an affordable rate. Communication with Ahmedabad is good; video stand-ups work well. The Indian workday sandwiches neatly between our office hours in London and Singapore. I now have two professional teams working in parallel, and I feel that together we are making great strides to the meet the varied needs of our clients.

Today's supercomputers, encrypted cell phones, and verification systems owe some of their development to work done for the NSA/CSS.

0,It was very clear from the start that this complex equipment was going to require a specially trained operations and maintenance staff. The Army Signal Corps responded by establishing the 805th Signal Service Company. Special training was provided in a BTL school, and members of the 805th were sent to all SIGSALY locations. The 805th was a very unusual company, to say the least. It consisted of eighty-one officers and two hundred and seventy-five enlisted. The officers were mostly lieutenants and captains, and the enlisted men were technical and master sergeants. This special company had the highest average grade of any company in World War II. A picture of part of the unit assigned to operate the equipment in the I. G. Farben building in Frankfurt, Germany, is in figure 4. Although technically not assigned to the 805th, members of the Women's Army Corps (WACs) performed a wide variety of duties related to SIGSALY including creating stenographic records of many of the important conversations.

0,Before the full involvement of the United States in WWII, the United States and the United Kingdom were using transatlantic high-frequency radio for voice communications between senior leaders. The analog voice privacy system in use, called the "A-3," provided reasonable protection against the casual eavesdropper, but it was vulnerable to anyone with sophisticated unscrambling capability. This system continued to be used during the early part of the war, and government officials were warned that they could be overheard. In fact, it was later discovered that a German station in the Netherlands was breaking out the conversations in real time. This situation was intolerable, but neither the U.S. nor the U.K. had a ready solution.

My mom, a nurse, worked at Group Health when I was a child, and I began working at the Research Institute in 2000. I am married to WPMG PA-C, Amy Mohelnitzky. Growing up—and to this day—conversations around the dinner table are frequently about health care. It is my unwavering belief that having access to high-quality health care is a fundamental human right. I want to be a part of an organization that is trying to improve the health care system and the health of our communities. The best thing about living in the Pacific Northwest is the easy access to both mountains and water. Year-round I take every opportunity to enjoy outdoor activities with my family, from biking to skiing.
0,This loss was made even more significant when combined with the drastic budget cuts that occurred at about the same time. There was no money to replace the individuals who had left the SIGINT world for civilian life. From 1945 until the start of the Korean War, President Truman slashed the U.S. military budget to help to pay off the deficit caused by the recently ended war and to finance foreign aid promised through the Marshall Plan. Due to this and the personnel cuts, SIGINT activities were drastically pared back to the minimum requirements; only the most critical needs were filled. These factors contributed, in part, to the formation of AFSA in May 1949 as an effort to survive the lean times by combining reduced SIGINT resources.

0,Transforming Data
0,Pushing and Storing Data
0,Frictionless Data is a progressive, incrementally adoptable open-source toolkit that brings simplicity and gracefulness to the data experience - whether you're wrangling a CSV or engineering complex pipelines with gigabytes.
0,Lean and minimal core. Quick to understand, quick to use.
0,Start with just what you need, scale as you grow.
0,We enhance rather than replace your existing tools and workflows.
0,Easily create reproducible research
0,Create pipelines without effort
0,Standardize data platforms
0,Data integration work will require a way to reliably discover internal and external data assets.
0,Data often requires some cleaning (integration) and conversions from one format to another.
0,With the data explosion it has become a job in itself to manage data - to push and store data.
0,explains the problem Frictionless Data addresses through simple specifications and software.
0,Simple container format used to describe and package data.
0,Publish and find data on the next generation data platform.
0,Validate data on every change so you catch errors before your users.
0,A light intuitive framework for building data processing flows.

0,Existing Tooling
0,Simple and Lightweight
0,Data integration is essential –- but currently painful and confusing. We want to bring simplicity and gracefulness to the messy world of data.
0,We want building data pipelines is as easy as playing with LEGO. We want a frictionless data ecosystem built on the unix philosophy where data flows with simplicity and grace across diverse tools and teams, enabled by the specs and patterns we have shared. We want everyone working with data to have access to these core patterns and tools.
0,We imagine a data ecosystem that is effortless, pure and clear. Where data flows everywhere, effortlessly and easily – like water.
0,We offer vision, patterns, specifications and tools that bring simplicity & ease to transform the data experience. We help you generate clean data efficiently and reliably gain ongoing insights. We help you standardize, package, validate, share, and publish your data.
0,We are here for the data wranglers and the data geeks. The people who work with data day to day – and those who design solutions for them. People who have moved beyond the quick hack in a notebook. People looking for the power of the command line but without the bulk and inelegance of big data tooling. They are data engineers and data scientists, researchers and technologists.
0,We work with, add to and enhance your existing tooling (progressive enhancement). We’re lightweight and coherent. We have a big vision and small tools. We cover the whole data journey to and from the end user – our patterns and tools can apply to Excel as well as Hadoop.
0,Each tool or pattern is focused on one part of the data chain, one specific feature – packaging – and a few specific types of data (e.g. tabular).
0,Build for the web using formats that are web “native” such as JSON, work naturally with HTTP such as plain text CSVs (which stream).
0,We design for a distributed ecosystem with no centralized, single point of failure or dependence.
0,Anyone should be able to freely and openly use and reuse what we build. Our community is open to everyone.
0,Integrate as easily as possible with existing tools both by building integrations and designing for direct use – for example we like CSV because everyone has a tool that can access CSV.
0,Add the minimum, do the least required, keep it simple. For example, use the most basic formats, require only the most essential metadata, data should have nothing extraneous.

0,Wir haben unu mit einer einfachen Mission gegründet: Die besten Mobilitätslösungen zu kreieren, die Dich mit Deiner Stadt verbinden und es Dir ermöglichen, das volle Potenzial des Stadtlebens auszuschöpfen. Finde mehr darüber heraus und lerne die Menschen und Partner hinter unu kennen.
0,Unsere drei Gründer Mathieu, Elias und Pascal haben in Großstädten auf der ganzen Welt gelebt und das erstaunliche Potenzial unserer Städte erlebt. Sie mussten jedoch auch schmerzhaft lernen, wie limitiert Städter daran sind, dieses Potential zu nutzen - da urbane Mobilität heute immer noch langsam, kompliziert, teuer und schmutzig ist.
0,Wir haben unu mit der Vision gegründet, allen Menschen den Zugang zum vollen Potenzial unserer Städte zu ermöglichen. Deshalb haben wir uns verschrieben, die besten Mobilitätslösungen zu entwickeln, die Dich mit Deiner Stadt verbinden. Unsere Mobilitätslösungen sollen bezahlbar, schnell, mühelos, sauber und ansprechend sein.
0,Drei große Mobilitätstrends ermöglichen unsere finale Vision des idealen Stadtfahrzeugs: ein elektrisches, vernetztes und autonomes Auto. Diese Vision werden wir durch drei Produktgenerationen verwirklichen, wobei wir einen Trend pro Generation meistern werden.
0,Du möchtest über uns schreiben?
0,1.0
0,Mit unserer ersten Produktgeneration, dem unu Scooter Classic, haben wir das erste Elektrofahrzeug geschaffen, das für jeden zugänglich ist: Es ist bezahlbar, einfach zu nutzen und ansprechend.
0,2.0
0,Mit der zweiten Produktgeneration vernetzen wir unsere Fahrzeuge. So wandeln wir sie in Plattformen für Mobilitätsdienste - wie z.B. Sharing - um und expandieren gleichzeitig in weitere Fahrzeugkategorien.
0,3.0
0,Sobald autonome Fahrtechnologie reif ist, werden wir sie in unser unu Car integrieren und unsere finale Produktvision, das ideale Stadtfahrzeug, realisieren.
0,Unsere Werte stehen im Mittelpunkt unserer Organisation: Sie begleiten uns bei jeder einzelnen Entscheidung - von der Produktentwicklung bis zum Gespräch mit unseren Kunden.
0,In einer Branche voller Riesen müssen wir uns einen schlanken und agilen Ansatz beibehalten – einen bedingungslosen Antrieb und Menschen, die als Team zusammenhalten und kämpfen, um jeden Goliath da draußen zu überlisten und zu überwältigen.
0,Wir sind stets bestrebt, die vielfältigen Möglichkeiten der Stadt zu erforschen und zu nutzen. Wir lieben es, eine tiefe Verbindung zu Menschen und Orten aufzubauen und zu pflegen. Alles, was wir bei unu tun, zielt darauf ab, diese Verbindungen zu ermöglichen und zu verbessern.
0,Wir sehen Raum für Verbesserungen in allem, was wir sehen und berühren. Wir lehnen nachlässige, komplexe und unintuitive Lösungen ab. Wir sind immer bestrebt Dinge besser zu machen, indem wir sie einfacher machen.
0,Wir glauben, dass das städtische Leben zu wichtig und zu groß ist, um es mit einer verschlossenen Denkweise anzugehen. Deshalb wollen wir radikal transparent und authentisch in dem sein was wir tun – und wie wir es tun. Wir geben immer unser ganzes Selbst, unsere Leidenschaft und unsere Persönlichkeit in das, was wir tun.
0,Unsere Kreativität ist das Ergebnis des unermüdlichen Hinterfragens davon, wie Dinge vor uns gemacht wurden und dem Ausprobieren von Neuem. Mit kindlichem Verstand müssen die ersten Fragen bei der Bewältigung jeder Herausforderung immer lauten: "Warum nicht?" und "Was wäre wenn?".
0,Unsere Unterstützer
0,Lerne die Menschen und Organisationen kennen, die uns unterstützen und uns auf unserer Reise begleiten.
0,Erfahre mehr über unseren Fertigungspartner Flex und warum wir mit ihm zusammenarbeiten.
0,Bei unserer Entscheidung für Flex haben wir großen Wert auf faire Arbeitsbedingungen gelegt. Flex begrenzt und kontrolliert Arbeitszeiten streng, achtet stark auf ein gesundes Arbeitsumfeld und engagiert sich mit z.B. einer eigenen Universität und Freizeitaktivitäten für das Wohl seiner Mitarbeiter.
0,Der Schutz der Umwelt steht im Mittelpunkt unseres Handelns bei unu und wir glauben, dass Sauberkeit in der Fabrik beginnt. So wird beispielsweise die Anlage zur Herstellung des unu Scooter mit Solarenergie betrieben.

0,Wir haben unu mit einer einfachen Mission gegründet: Die besten Mobilitätslösungen zu kreieren, die Dich mit Deiner Stadt verbinden und es Dir ermöglichen, das volle Potenzial des Stadtlebens auszuschöpfen. Finde mehr darüber heraus und lerne die Menschen und Partner hinter unu kennen.
0,Unsere drei Gründer Mathieu, Elias und Pascal haben in Großstädten auf der ganzen Welt gelebt und das erstaunliche Potenzial unserer Städte erlebt. Sie mussten jedoch auch schmerzhaft lernen, wie limitiert Städter daran sind, dieses Potential zu nutzen - da urbane Mobilität heute immer noch langsam, kompliziert, teuer und schmutzig ist.
0,Wir haben unu mit der Vision gegründet, allen Menschen den Zugang zum vollen Potenzial unserer Städte zu ermöglichen. Deshalb haben wir uns verschrieben, die besten Mobilitätslösungen zu entwickeln, die Dich mit Deiner Stadt verbinden. Unsere Mobilitätslösungen sollen bezahlbar, schnell, mühelos, sauber und ansprechend sein.
0,Drei große Mobilitätstrends ermöglichen unsere finale Vision des idealen Stadtfahrzeugs: ein elektrisches, vernetztes und autonomes Auto. Diese Vision werden wir durch drei Produktgenerationen verwirklichen, wobei wir einen Trend pro Generation meistern werden.
0,Du möchtest über uns schreiben?
0,1.0
0,Mit unserer ersten Produktgeneration, dem unu Scooter Classic, haben wir das erste Elektrofahrzeug geschaffen, das für jeden zugänglich ist: Es ist bezahlbar, einfach zu nutzen und ansprechend.
0,2.0
0,Mit der zweiten Produktgeneration vernetzen wir unsere Fahrzeuge. So wandeln wir sie in Plattformen für Mobilitätsdienste - wie z.B. Sharing - um und expandieren gleichzeitig in weitere Fahrzeugkategorien.
0,3.0
0,Sobald autonome Fahrtechnologie reif ist, werden wir sie in unser unu Car integrieren und unsere finale Produktvision, das ideale Stadtfahrzeug, realisieren.
0,Unsere Werte stehen im Mittelpunkt unserer Organisation: Sie begleiten uns bei jeder einzelnen Entscheidung - von der Produktentwicklung bis zum Gespräch mit unseren Kunden.
0,In einer Branche voller Riesen müssen wir uns einen schlanken und agilen Ansatz beibehalten – einen bedingungslosen Antrieb und Menschen, die als Team zusammenhalten und kämpfen, um jeden Goliath da draußen zu überlisten und zu überwältigen.
0,Wir sind stets bestrebt, die vielfältigen Möglichkeiten der Stadt zu erforschen und zu nutzen. Wir lieben es, eine tiefe Verbindung zu Menschen und Orten aufzubauen und zu pflegen. Alles, was wir bei unu tun, zielt darauf ab, diese Verbindungen zu ermöglichen und zu verbessern.
0,Wir sehen Raum für Verbesserungen in allem, was wir sehen und berühren. Wir lehnen nachlässige, komplexe und unintuitive Lösungen ab. Wir sind immer bestrebt Dinge besser zu machen, indem wir sie einfacher machen.
0,Wir glauben, dass das städtische Leben zu wichtig und zu groß ist, um es mit einer verschlossenen Denkweise anzugehen. Deshalb wollen wir radikal transparent und authentisch in dem sein was wir tun – und wie wir es tun. Wir geben immer unser ganzes Selbst, unsere Leidenschaft und unsere Persönlichkeit in das, was wir tun.
0,Unsere Kreativität ist das Ergebnis des unermüdlichen Hinterfragens davon, wie Dinge vor uns gemacht wurden und dem Ausprobieren von Neuem. Mit kindlichem Verstand müssen die ersten Fragen bei der Bewältigung jeder Herausforderung immer lauten: "Warum nicht?" und "Was wäre wenn?".
0,Unsere Unterstützer
0,Lerne die Menschen und Organisationen kennen, die uns unterstützen und uns auf unserer Reise begleiten.
0,Erfahre mehr über unseren Fertigungspartner Flex und warum wir mit ihm zusammenarbeiten.
0,Bei unserer Entscheidung für Flex haben wir großen Wert auf faire Arbeitsbedingungen gelegt. Flex begrenzt und kontrolliert Arbeitszeiten streng, achtet stark auf ein gesundes Arbeitsumfeld und engagiert sich mit z.B. einer eigenen Universität und Freizeitaktivitäten für das Wohl seiner Mitarbeiter.
0,Der Schutz der Umwelt steht im Mittelpunkt unseres Handelns bei unu und wir glauben, dass Sauberkeit in der Fabrik beginnt. So wird beispielsweise die Anlage zur Herstellung des unu Scooter mit Solarenergie betrieben.
